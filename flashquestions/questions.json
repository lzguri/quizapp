This results in increased nitrogen absorption. Additionally, normocytic anemia may develop due to blood loss, and reactive thrombocytosis can occur as a compensatory response.

In acute GI bleeding, hemoglobin may initially remain normal because blood loss is occurring without immediate plasma volume replacement. Hemoglobin levels drop over time as the body compensates by shifting fluid into the vascular space (hemodilution), making it a late marker of blood loss.
