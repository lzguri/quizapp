He reported generalized weakness, fatigue, and increased thirst. He admitted to not taking his insulin during this period due to fear of hypoglycemia, as he had been unable to eat adequately. The patient has a history of recurrent episodes of nausea and vomiting, which were previously managed with metoclopramide, though he has not used it recently. His symptoms had been getting worse over the past 48 hours. He also described occasional tingling sensations in his hands and feet, along with mild difficulty with balance and persistent fatigue. He denied fever, chills, and chest pain but reported shortness of breath. He also denied recent infections, changes in bowel habits, or trauma",

        "explanation": "Although serum potassium may be high in a hyperglycemic, acidotic state, total body potassium is usually depleted. This occurs because acidosis shifts potassium out of cells, raising serum levels, while osmotic diuresis from hyperglycemia causes significant potassium losses in urine. As a result, patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA] who appear to have a normal or high serum potassium level still require potassium supplementation to prevent dangerous hypokalemia during treatment. In fact, potassium supplementation is usually started if the patient’s serum potassium is below 5.3 mEq/L to avoid a drop to dangerously low levels once insulin therapy begins"
