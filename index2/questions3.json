He reported generalized weakness, fatigue, and increased thirst. He admitted to not taking his insulin during this period due to fear of hypoglycemia, as he had been unable to eat adequately. The patient has a history of recurrent episodes of nausea and vomiting, which were previously managed with metoclopramide, though he has not used it recently. His symptoms had been getting worse over the past 48 hours. He also described occasional tingling sensations in his hands and feet, along with mild difficulty with balance and persistent fatigue. He denied fever, chills, and chest pain but reported shortness of breath. He also denied recent infections, changes in bowel habits, or trauma",

Myxedema coma is unlikely given that it typically presents with bradycardia, hypothermia, and a depressed respiratory rate, opposite to what we are seeing in this case",
